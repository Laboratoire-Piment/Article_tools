	abstract = {The activated sludges and the sugarcane distillery wastewater (vinasse) are two different types of liquid wastes generated throughout the domestic wastewater treatment and sugarcane molasses fermentation and distillation respectively. In Reunion Island, sludge is currently discarded in landfills. Regarding the vinasse, a part of the production is treated by anaerobic digestion process. However, the remaining part is diluted then discharged into the sea 900 m of the coast. In this study, the mesophilic biochemical methane potential (BMP) test, with different inoculum to substrate (I/S) ratios, are presented in this paper as well as the methane production and kinetic results. The BMP is modelled by both the first order linear regression and the modified Gompertz model. In a future study, we will propose an alternative solution in order to treat both wastes simultaneously while producing energy with the co-digestion of the vinasse and the activated sludges in semi-industrial scale.},

Notes : The highest methane production is obtained with the ratio D followed by the ratio C, thenthe ratio B and the ratio A with the lowest production. The methane production increase when the I/S ratio decreases. The methane potential of the vinasse (ratio D) is 109.58 NlCH4.kgCOD-1 after 16 days with abiodegradability of 0.31. Consequently, in the case of BMP vinasse test, we should use an I(VS)/S(VS) of 1. Aspreviously said, this ratio (inferior or equal to 1) is recommended for less degradable substrates. Moreover, the maximum methane production is reached between 12 and 19 days for the four ratios},

	abstract = {Microbial population dynamics were investigated during start-up and during periods of overload conditions in anaerobic co-digesters treating municipal solid waste and sewage sludge. Changes in community structure were monitored using ribosomal RNA-based oligonucleotide probe hybridization to measure the abundance of syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria (SPOB), saturated fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophs (SFAS), and methanogens. These changes were linked to traditional performance parameters such as biogas production and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations. Digesters with high levels of Archaea started up successfully. Methanosaeta concilii was the dominant aceticlastic methanogen in these systems. In contrast, digesters that experienced a difficult start-up period had lower levels of Archaea with proportionally more abundant Methanosarcina spp. Syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria and saturated fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophs were present at low levels in all digesters, and SPOB appeared to play a role in stabilizing propionate levels during start-up of one digester. Digesters with a history of poor performance tolerated a severe organic overload event better than digesters that had previously performed well. It is hypothesized that higher levels of SPOB and SFAS and their methanogenic partners in previously unstable digesters are responsible for this behavior.},

Physicochemical analysis were performed on the digestate, and on three samples collected at three different depths, providing a local insight of the digester before and after mixing. The mixing speed varied from 20 to 60 rpm. The biogas production gradually increased with a maximum production of 477 LCH4·kgCOD−1 at 60 rpm. Anaerobic digestion was more destabilized at higher mixing speeds, with the increase of biogas production variations. Variations in VFA (volatile fatty acids) and ammonium concentrations were apparent in parallel of biogas production variations. The optimal range of VFA concentration was 8 to 10 g·L−1. The VFA / Alk ratio stabilized at the ratio of 0.5 to 0.7. The acidic zones were located in the sludge. A release of VFA from the sludge to the liquid phase was noticed after mixing.},

	abstract = {Currently, following the example of solar photovoltaic and wind power, the anaerobic digestion can be a strategic choice for the promotion of green energy in Morocco, thanks to the significant potential of biomassavailable in the Kingdom and due to its strong commitment to environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development. Although the sector appeared to be very promising, it remains largely unexploited, can be explained by its relatively low yields due to the non-masteryof the process. This study is put forward in that context which focuses on the optimization of this process operating conditions, specifically the study of the influence of the agitation on its effectiveness. Therefore, we performed a series of experiments covering the variation of the mode, intensity and agitation frequency. As for the mode, we choose three types of agitation (continuous, intermittent and without agitation), in terms of intensity, we took values ranging between 20, 40, 60, 100 and 160rpm (revolutions per minute), and as to the frequency, we opted for a range of 2h, 4h, 8h and 12h. For all experiments, the fermentation has been carried out under a temperature of 40°C ± 0,6 which constitutes a mesophilic system, with a retention time fixed at 21 days and a reduction in particle size to 10 mm [1-3]. The results showed a significant reduction of approximately 62\% of the production of biogas for digestion without agitation, compared to the two other systems with continuous or intermittent agitation, which is mainly due to the formation of a crust at the surface preventing the proper degassing. Other experiments with different agitation intensities demonstrated that an agitation at low rotation speed, under the intermittent mode, allows a better biogas production. As for the frequencies of agitation, they were validated in such a way as to avoid crust formation in the digester in order to ensure better efficiency of the process.},

Many studies are based on the analysis of a small number of samples, which are don't present a complete picture of all the types of food waste. The organic composition and other factors such as pH, temperature, C/N ratio of the samples varies considerably with the region, the season and the processing characteristics, resulting in methane yield variations, ranging from 216 to 1476 mL CH4/gVS.

The intensification of separate biowastes collection in most European countries has also contributed to the development of biodegradable plastics, and the subject of their end-of-life is becoming a key issue. To date, there has been relatively little research to evaluate the biodegradability of biodegradable plastics by anaerobic digestion (AD) compared to industrial and home composting. However, anaerobic digestion is a particularly promising strategy for treating biodegradable organic wastes in the context of circular waste management. This critical review aims to provide an in-depth update of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable plastics by providing a summary of the literature regarding process performance, parameters affecting biodegradability, the microorganisms involved, and some of the strategies (e.g., pretreatment, additives, and inoculum acclimation) used to enhance the degradation rate of biodegradable plastics. In addition, a critical section is dedicated to suggestions and recommendations for the development of biodegradable plastics sector and their treatment in anaerobic digestion.},

Seven arrangements of TPAD systems under mesophilic conditions were evaluated, each containing one acidogenic reactor and one methanogenic reactor. The work analyzed two HRTs (2 and 3 days) and four OLRs (2, 3, 4 and 5 kgVS.m−3.d−1). The 2D5KG system obtained VS and COD removal of 68\% and 72\%; SMP of 273 Lmethane.kg.VS−1. The 3D4KG system obtained VS and COD removal of 70 and 66\%; SMP of 252 Lmethane.kg.VS−1. Valeric acid predominated in the acidogenic reactor in both HRT and OLR evaluated, followed by butyric acid. In the methanogenic reactor, the main methane production route was the butyric acid conversion into acetic acid and finally methane. Higher OLR benefits the methane production. The microbiological profile indicated the pathway of methanogenesis by acetoclastic methanogenesis. The canonical correlation analysis allowed to verify that the groups are independent and, therefore, the variables analyzed in the acidogenic reactor have an influence on the methanogenic reactor.},

Mesophilic temperature (T) coupled to 5.0 days as hydraulic retention time (HRT) gave a VFA-rich stream with an overall concentration of 24.4 ± 0.2 g CODVFA/L, dominated by propionic and valeric acids, and high acidification yield, being VFA close to 90\% of the soluble COD. The pH was maintained around 7.0 by the digestate recirculation from the second methanation reactor (HRT of 20 days) where biogas production was quantified under mesophilic and thermophilic T. The assessment of energy balance showed the benefits to carry out the second methanation stage under thermophilic condition, having more income from electricity generation without losing the thermal sustainability of the two-phases process as a whole.},

	abstract = {Biogas upgradation (BU) is an alternative route for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration for increasing biogas utilization/reuse in integrating processes for the commercialization of technologies. This chapter critically discusses the current state-of-the-art of BU in the global context with the specific concepts required for research and development (R\&D) applications for centralized and decentralized applications for commercialization. It also discusses future perspectives that essentially help in overcoming the challenges faced at the R\&D stage in terms of biogas production and reuse to achieve energy-intensive processes. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a potential bioconversion process utilized for treating diverse waste/wastewaters for energy and product generation. Apart from its efficiency, AD also has few limitations that need to be overcome for recovering maximum methane (CH4). The integration of electrochemical processes with interference of electrodes as electron acceptors in microbial processes could beneficially help in direct utilization of electrical energy for BU by converting CO2 to CH4 to achieve higher process efficiency. It influences the overall CH4 yield, while providing new insights to counteract the operational instability of bioprocesses like AD through applied potential by altering the in situ microbial reactions. The integration of the centralized and decentralized biogas upgrading units in bioprocess units helps to improve the sustainability of the individual processes in a circular economy system. The industrial perspective for commercialization of BU as a technology reveals significant applications for decreasing the gaseous carbon footprints for enhanced biobased product generation using a biological route.},

The hydraulic retention time (HRT) critically influences an increase in biogas production/upgradation. It indicates the period of time at which the productivity could start to decline, while the organic fermentable substrate remains in the anaerobic digester. Increased HRT will require a large digester volume, increasing the overall operational cost, while a shorter HRT will remove the active bacterial population (Sreekrishnan et al., 2004). Maximum CH4 production and its upgradation essentially occur at optimized HRTs. The optimized HRT mainly depends on the type of biocatalyst (mixed or pure culture) and the OLR. A shorter retention period leads to VFA accumulation that causes severe fouling, resulting in decreased biogas production, whereas if the retention time is longer, the biogas components are not utilized effectively, resulting in decreased biogas production (Chen et al., 2016; Dobre et al., 2014). HRT also depends on the reactor size and volume (L/D ratio), where in lab-scale operations, the HRT is much less because of the small reactor size, but in contrast the HRT in centralized biogas systems is high to due pilot-level operations. Hence, HRT needs to be considered for BU for increased CH4 production during an integrated process.},

	abstract = {Manure contains nitrogen and phosphorus, however, the overuse of nutrients will cause eutrophication, and pathogens, heavy metals, antibiotics residues, and antibiotics genes in manure could bring harmful effects, which require a series of processes for manure treatment. Firstly, solid-liquid separation is used to remove solids from manure slurry and to make both solid and liquid phases more suitable for further biological treatment. Then, composting is used to promote the transformation of biodegradable organic matter into stable humus; manure can be also stabilized through anaerobic digestion, generating biogas as clean energy, reducing manure volume, disinfecting the manure, and recycling the nutrients. Different kinds of biogas plants have been developed for the anaerobic treatment of manure and slurry. The continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), plug flow reactor (PFR), and up-flow solid reactor (USR) are widely used. The land application of surplus untreated manure could result in leachates to underground water. Proper application is, therefore, very important; band spreading and injection technology can assist with this. From the perspective of environmental risks, pathogens, mosquitoes, and heavy metals should be controlled before land application; meanwhile, nutrients limitation is also essential.},

Hydraulic retention time (HRT) is defined as the average time interval over which the substrate is kept inside the digester. The organic load rate (OLR) is determined as organic matter feed-in per unit time and volume of the reactor.
The level of OLR directly affects the volumetric gas production rate of the anaerobic digestion system. Excessive organic load may cause the accumulation of volatile fatty acids, and then affect the acid-base balance of the system and reduce the metabolic activity of microorganisms. Otherwise, low organic load will not only make the reactor operate with high unit operation cost, but also lead to starvation of microorganisms and fail to give full play to their metabolic activity. Significant volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation, which leads to incomplete manure stabilization, would occur when HRT is too short or OLR is too high. Unmatured digestate would exert harmful impacts on crops (Gerber and Span, 2008).},
